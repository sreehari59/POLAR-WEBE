# POLAR - WEBE (POLAR Word Embeddings for Business Entities)

With increased automation in the fields of language analysis, new possibilities emerge to gain insights on different social topics. Since explainable machine learning models need to be applied to gain insights into research fields, various approaches in this direction have been developed. As such an approach to explaining natural language models is the POLAR framework, we take a deeper look at the methodology and expand it. The research looks into 3 directions:

  1.  Clustering and PCA to conduct a graphical analysis of word embeddings and check the quality of the selected POLAR dimensions with an annotator test
  2.  Analyze bias in the different word embeddings through t-tests
  3.  Analyze the cultural differences between the embedded entities with Hofstedeâ€™s framework
